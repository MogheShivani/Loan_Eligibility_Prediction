# Loan_Eligibility_Prediction
This project is a learning exercise aimed at predicting loan eligibility for applicants based on various features such as income, credit score, and employment history. It utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze historical loan application data and make predictions.
## Overview

The loan eligibility prediction project was developed as part of my learning journey in data science and machine learning. It serves as a practical application of predictive modeling techniques learned through tutorials and self-study.

## Project Details

- The dataset used for this project contains historical loan application data, including features such as income, credit score, loan amount, and loan status.
- Machine learning algorithms, including Decision Tree and Naive Bayes classification, KNN
- The Decision Tree algorithm achieved an accuracy of 72.71%, the KNN has accuracy of 78.14%, Random Forest has accuracy 78.92%
- The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment on Google Colab.

## YouTube Reference

This project was developed following the "Loan Eligibility Prediction Tutorial" by Edureka on YouTube. The tutorial provided valuable guidance on data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation techniques.
